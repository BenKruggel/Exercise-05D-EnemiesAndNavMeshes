Created complex labyrinth with material textures, light sources, enemies, interactable items, scoring system, abilites, mechanics, juiciness and more. Created movement mechanics from scratch. Created labyrinth with progression, secrets, hints and clear objective. Created complementary abilities for player. (speed boost, level reset option, movement, interactive enemies and items). Added deliberate lighting and decorative elements. Functional menu and end screens with original music and art, and controls information. Original soundtrack and sound effects for level and menus. SECRET ENDING!
